Small tool to delete all empty folders in a folder structure, check for all video files that dont have av1 already in the name, and reencode them into AV1. 
I did this mostly for saving HDD space of nvidia instant replay but can be editted for anything ofcourse.

### Remember
Edit the paths accordingly in the python script

It uses the nvenc AV1 encoder so make sure you have a RTX 4000 GPU
